# Jumia Deals Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to scrape data from the Jumia website to create a comprehensive list of all products currently offered at a discount. By leveraging various web scraping and data processing tools, we collect, analyze, and present this information in a user-friendly format. The project involves extracting data using Python and popular scraping libraries, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building an interactive UI for users to view discounted products.

## Features

- **Data Scraping**: Extract product details from Jumia, focusing on discounted items.
- **Data Processing**: Clean and preprocess the scraped data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the data to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Interactive UI**: Display discounted products using Dash..

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Core programming language for all tasks.
- **Beautiful Soup**: Library for parsing HTML and XML documents.
- **Requests**: Library for making HTTP requests.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**:  Library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Dash**: Web framework for building analytical web applications.
